# The different types of cloud computing 
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
    - IaaS is the most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
    - To understand IaaS, it’s helpful to understand the different components that make up IT infrastructure.
    - Compute: This is the processing power that drives your applications. In an on-premises environment, you might be used to thinking about compute in terms of physical servers. In the cloud, you instead purchase processing capacity in the form of virtual machines (VMs).
    - Storage: This is the component that stores all of your data in the cloud. Cloud storage can take the form of block storage, which is essentially hard disks in the cloud, or object storage, which is a collection of files in the cloud. You can also use cloud storage to move data between on-premises storage systems and public cloud systems.
    - Networking: This is how your users and applications are able to access your cloud (and on-premises) resources. Networking components include virtual private clouds (VPCs), firewalls, gateways, and private and public network connections.
    - IaaS provides you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and is most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.
    - IaaS is the best choice if you want to have complete control over your infrastructure and do most of the management of it yourself.
    - IaaS is also a good option if you have workloads that are temporary, experimental, or change unexpectedly.
    - IaaS is a good choice if you need to quickly add computing capacity, or if you have workloads that are temporary, experimental, or change unexpectedly.   

- Platform as a service (PaaS)
    - PaaS products are platforms that help developers write and manage their own applications. PaaS products generally include the same types of components as IaaS offerings, but also include the middleware, development tools, and other tools needed to support the development and deployment of applications.
    - PaaS products are designed to support the complete web application lifecycle: building, testing, deploying, managing, and updating within the same integrated environment.
    - PaaS products are best suited for situations where developers want to focus on writing code without worrying about the underlying infrastructure, where the requirements of the application may change over time, or where you want to build a cloud-native application that can run in the cloud without requiring you to manage the underlying infrastructure.
    - PaaS is a good choice if you want to deploy software quickly, if your application has regular traffic changes, or if you want to develop an application that can run in the cloud without requiring you to manage any runtime environments.

- Software as a service (SaaS)
    - SaaS is a method for delivering software applications over the Internet, on demand and typically on a subscription basis. With SaaS, cloud providers host and manage the software application and underlying infrastructure, and handle any maintenance, like software upgrades and security patching. Users connect to the application over the Internet, usually with a web browser on their phone, tablet, or PC.
    - SaaS is a good choice if you want to quickly add a particular capability to your application, or if you want to provide your users with a fully functional application without having to build it from scratch.
