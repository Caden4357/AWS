# What is cloud computing
- Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.
- You can provision exactly the right type and size of computing resources you need to power your newest bright idea or operate your IT department.
- You can access as many resources as you need, almost instantly, and only pay for what you use.
- Simple way to access servers storage databases and a broad set of application services over the internet.

# Deployment models
- Cloud computing deployment models refer to where the cloud services are located.
- There are three different ways to deploy cloud services: on a public cloud, private cloud, or hybrid cloud.
- Public cloud: A public cloud is owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider, which delivers cloud services over the internet.  
- Private cloud: A private cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single business or organization. A private cloud can be physically located on the company’s on-site datacenter. Some companies also pay third-party service providers to host their private cloud. A private cloud is one in which the services and infrastructure are maintained on a private network.
- Hybrid cloud: A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them.

# Five characteristics of cloud computing
- On-demand self-service: A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
- Broad network access: Resources available over the network and accessed by diverse client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
- Multi Tenacity & Resource pooling: Multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and applications with security and privacy.
Multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources, but these resources are logically separated. The customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources. Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
- Rapid elasticity: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
i.e you can have 1000 servers today and 10 tomorrow. Quickly and easily scale based on demand.
- Measured service: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
i.e you pay for what you use. You can monitor your usage and set limits.

# Six advantages of cloud computing
- Trade capital expense for variable expense: Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
- Benefit from massive economies of scale: By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
- Stop guessing capacity: Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often either end up sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.
- Increase speed and agility: In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only ever a click away, which means you reduce the time it takes to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.
- Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers: Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
- Go global in minutes: Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide a lower latency and better experience for your customers at minimal cost.
