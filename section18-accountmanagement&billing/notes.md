# Organizations 
    - Organizations are a way to group accounts together. manage them as a single entity. 
    - consilation billing, control access, and share resources across accounts, discount pricing, pooled resources
    - API driven
    - 2 types of accounts: master and member
    - send cloudwatch logs to a central account
    - common exam questions:
        - consolidated billing
        - pricing benefit from aggregated usage
        - pooling of reserved instances for savings 
        - api available to automate aws account creation
        - restrict account privileges using service control policies (SCP)
# consolidated billing  
    - one bill for all accounts
    - volume pricing discount
    - reserved instance pooling
    - easy to track charges
# control tower 
    - set up and govern a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment based on best practices established through AWS' experience working with thousands of enterprises as they move to the cloud
    - automate the set-up of a new baseline multi-account AWS environment that is secure, well-architected, and ready to use
    - runs on top of organizations
    - 3 main components:
        - **Organizational Units (OUs)**: a collection of AWS accounts within an organization. OUs help you manage your AWS accounts by grouping them based on your organizational model. 
        - **Service Control Policies (SCPs)**: a type of policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization. SCPs offer central control over the maximum available permissions for all accounts in your organization. 
        - **Guardrails**: a set of rules that enforce policies or best practices in your organization. Guardrails help to ensure that your accounts stay within your organizationâ€™s guidelines.
# Resource Access Manager (RAM)
    - share aws resources that you own with other aws accounts

# Pricing models (Go back through this section)
    - 4 different pricing models:
